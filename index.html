						South Korea, while modern and developed, still cherishes her traditions, unique culture and history. All of this is vividly preserved in villages, museums, monasteries, parks and an extraordinarily scenic landscape shaped by centuries of agriculture, battles, and dynasties.
						On this adventure, you’ll have a native, personal guide who speaks fluent English for rich days of learning, reflection, photography and cross-cultural interaction. Visit the DMZ to better understand the history and fraught relationship of the two Koreas. Travel by local train, fly to legendary Jeju Island and get a feeling for the soul of Seoul. Explore the recreated antiquity of Andong and marvel at the dynastic magnificence of Gyeongju’s tombs, palaces, and temples.</span>

					<td style="width: 60%; padding:5px"> <center><h2>Gyeongbokgung Palace (경복궁)</h2></center>Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace is commonly referred to as the Northern Palace because its location is furthest north when compared to the neighboring palaces of Changdeokgung (Eastern Palace) and Gyeonghuigung (Western Palace). Gyeongbokgung Palace is arguably the most beautiful, and remains the largest of all five palaces.

					The premises were once destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592-1598). However, all of the palace buildings were later restored under the leadership of Heungseondaewongun during the reign of King Gojong (1852-1919).

					Remarkably, the most representative edifices of the Joseon dynasty, Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and the pond around Hyangwonjeong Pavilion have remained relatively intact. The raised dias and stone markers of Geunjeongjeon showcase the representative art style of their time.</td>

You'll be taken inside the meeting room – where the 1953 truce was signed – the only place where you can safely walk into North Korea.

						Tours kick off with a briefing by US or Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea) soldier guides at Camp Bonifas, the joint US–ROK army camp just outside the DMZ, before being transferred to another bus to the JSA. </center></td>

A favorite with newlyweds (and K-drama fans), this popular retreat is also home to miles of golden beaches, winding coastal trails, and Jeju Waterworld, the area’s largest water park. No matter what your fancy, one thing is for certain: a day of sightseeing isn’t complete without enjoying some of the isle’s delicious raw seafood and famed barbecued black pork.</center></td></div>
